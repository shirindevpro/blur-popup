    The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa
    omeiensis and Rosa sericea, which usually have only four. Each petal is
    divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a
    few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the
    case of some Rosa omeiensis and Rosa sericea, four). These may be long
    enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points
    alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries
    that develop into achenes.[5] Roses are insect-pollinated in nature. The
    aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip.
    Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so
    tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips
    of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark
    purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the
    hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded
    fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose
    hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose
    (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any
    plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and
    waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds,
    particularly finches, also eat the seeds. The sharp growths along a rose
    stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths
    of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true
    thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped
    hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over
    it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely
    packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by
    animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so
    reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally
    on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are
    frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial
    prickles that have no points.
